# lizard-torch-course

I compile here the notebooks I wrote following the course [__Neural Network Programming - Deep Learning with PyTorch__](https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG) by [deeplizard](https://twitter.com/deeplizard). I've been becoming increasingly interested with PyTorch recently since it feels very Pythonic.
